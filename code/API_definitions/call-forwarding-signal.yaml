  title: Call Forwarding Signal
  description: |
    # Overview
    The Call Forwarding Signal API provides the API Consumer with
    information about the status of the Call Forwarding Service on a specific
    phone number. The main scope of the Call Forwarding Signal API is "anti
    Fraud" to avoid fraudsters to use the Call Forwarding Service to carry
    on a scam. Other use cases are anyway supported by the Call Forwarding
    Signal API that also
    provides additional endpoints to detect the general Call Forwarding
    Service settings.
    # Introduction
    The Call Forwarding Service is provided by the Network to a phone
    number. This service redirects the incoming call to that phone number
    to an alternative destination such as another phone number or a voice mail
    system. There are two main types of call forwarding settings:
    unconditional and conditional.
    The Call Forwarding Signal API can be invoked to detect if the unconditional
    call forwarding service is active. The Call Forwarding Signal API can also
    be invoked to
    get the general status of the Call Forwarding Service (inactive,
    conditional, unconditional). If conditional call forwarding is active,
    the different type of settings are returned ('conditional_busy',
    'conditional_not_reachable', 'conditional_no_answer').

    **Example use cases:**

    [**Bank Frauds**](https://github.com/camaraproject/CallForwardingSignal/discussions/3#discussioncomment-8694420)

    [**Alert Interception**](https://github.com/camaraproject/CallForwardingSignal/discussions/3#discussioncomment-8701847)

    [**Call Forwarding Verification**](https://github.com/camaraproject/CallForwarding\Signal/discussions/3#discussioncomment-8915595)
    # Quick Start
    The Call Forwarding Signal API is a REST API based on the
    CreateCallForwardingSignal resource.
    This resource can be used, by the API Consumer, to specify the phone number
    on which the Call Forwarding Service status must be verified, in case of
    two-legged authentication. If three-legged authentication is used the phone
    number is instead detected, by the API Producer, from the access token.

    Before starting to use the Call Forwarding API, the developer needs to know
    about the below specified details:

    **phoneNumber**
    This is the end user phone number. The Call Forwarding Signal API verifies
    if a call forwarding
    service is active on this phone number. Note: this parameter must be
    must be provided/valued only in case of two-legged authentication.
    In case of three-legged authentication the phone number is retrieved by
    the access token.

    **CreateCallForwardingSignal**
    This is the resource the API Consumer uses to define the phone number to
    be verified about the status of the Network Call Forwarding service.

    **UnconditionalCallForwardingSignal**
    This is the resource the API Consumer gets back, containing the information
    about the Unconditional Call Forwarding Service status for the given phone
    number (PhoneNumber).

    **CallForwardingSignal**
    This is the resource the API Consumer gets back, containing the information
    about the general status of the Network Call Forwarding service for the
    specified phone number.

    The Call Forwarding Signal API provides two endpoints fulfilling the
    following intents:
    - **unconditional-call-forwardings**: Is the unconditional call fwd service
    active on a specific phone number?
    - **call-forwardings**: Which is the status of the call forwarding for a
    specific phone number?
    # API Documentation
    ## Details
    The Call Forwarding Signal API is invoked by an API Consumer after the
    Consent Management flow.

    The API Consumer can request the API Producer for the status of the
    Unconditional Call Forwarding service using the
    unconditional-call-forwardings POST method. A boolean, with the information
    about the activation status of the call forwarding service, will be
    provided back via the UnconditionalCallForwardingSignal resource.

    The API Consumer can also request the API Producer for the generic status of
    the Call Forwarding service using the call-forwardings POST method. An array
    of strings with the information of the type of active call forwarding
    services will be provided back via the CallForwardingSignal resource.
    # Authorization and authentication
    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details of how
    an API consumer requests an access token. Please refer to Identity and
    Consent Management
    (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/)
    for the released version of the profile.

    The specific authorization flows to be used will be agreed upon during the
    onboarding process, happening between the API consumer and the API
    provider, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API,
    whilst also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by
    local legislation.

    In cases where personal data is processed by the API and users can
    exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out,
    the use of three-legged access tokens is mandatory. This ensures that
    the API remains in compliance with privacy regulations, upholding the
    principles of transparency and user-centric privacy-by-design.
    # Identifying the phone number from the access token
    This API requires the API consumer to identify a phone number as the
    subject of the API as follows:
    - When the API is invoked using a two-legged access token, the subject
    will be identified from the optional `phoneNumber` object field, which
    therefore MUST be provided.
    - When a three-legged access token is used however, this optional
    identifier MUST NOT be provided, as the subject will be uniquely
    identified from the access token.

    This approach simplifies API usage for API consumers using a
    three-legged access token to invoke the API by relying on the
    information that is associated with the access token and was
    identified during the authentication process.
    ## Error handling:

    - If the subject cannot be identified from the access token and the
    optional `phoneNumber` object field is not included in the request, then
    the server will return an error with the
    `422 MISSING_IDENTIFIER` error code.

    - If the subject can be identified from the access token and the
    optional `phoneNumber` object field is also included in the request, then
    the server will return an error with the `422 UNNECESSARY_IDENTIFIER`
    error code. This will be the case even if the same device is
    identified by these two methods, as the server is unable to make
    this comparison.

    # Additional CAMARA error responses
    The list of error codes in this API specification is not exhaustive.
    Therefore the API specification may not document some non-mandatory error
    statuses as indicated in `CAMARA API Design Guide`.

    Please refer to the `CAMARA_common.yaml` of the Commonalities Release
    associated to this API version for a complete list of error responses.
    The applicable Commonalities Release can be identified in the
    `API Readiness Checklist` document associated to this API version.

    As a specific rule, error `501 - NOT_IMPLEMENTED` can be only a possible
    error response if it is explicitly documented in the API.
